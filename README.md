# Pumpkin Cauldron

![demo](readme_attachments/)

Here's the pumpkin I built for the 2019 Paradowski Pumpkin Carving Contest.

Years ago I head the idea to create an interactive cauldron that triggered sound effects, lights, and fans to blow smoke when you waved RFID tags over a reader. I wrote the idea down in one of my good-idea notebooks and moved on because at that time I didn't know enough of the technology (or even enough of the electrical engineering concepts) to actually make it happen. That said, I knew that at some point I'd be able to figure it out. That some point ended up being the end of 2019 :)

You can find a ton of project status videos that I shot throughout the making of the pumpkin [here on my vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6256505).
